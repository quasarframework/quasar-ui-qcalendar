What this does, is instead of returning a timestamp with the exact time of the click position, it returns the timestamp of the interval. If normally, your timestamp would have a time of **13:20**, this property makes it return **13:00**. This is also based on your settings of `interval-minutes`. If your `interval-minutes` is set to **15**, then the same click above would return a timestamp with time set to **13:15**.\n\n**Day** and **Week** calendars now have the ability to toggle selected intervals or a range of selected intervals (even across multiple days) with properties `selected-dates` and `selected-start-end-dates`. These properties not only need the date (like the month view uses), but also the time (use the Timestamp exported method `getDateTime`). See the Week examples to learn how to do this.\n\n**Timestamp** has a new exported method: `getDateTimeIdentifier` which is a convenience method that combines `getDayIdentifier` and `getTimeIdentifier`.\n\nYou can find out more information [here](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-ui-qcalendar/releases/tag/v3.2.0).\n\n**v3.0.0**: As QCalendar strives to be the most exstensible calendar available, to be consistent with this ideology, we had to make a LOT of changes.\n\nAmong other updates, several things have become "native" for QCalendar:\n1. The largest overhaul was introducing css vars to allow users the ability to customize QCalendar\n2. QCalendar was compared to dozens of other calendars and the look was optimized to be more modern\n3. The original theming has been removed. The css vars are 25% faster than the previous theming code\n4. You no longer need to provide a `.q-active-date` class of your own. You can now change the active date colors via css vars\n5. You no longer need to hook into the styles properties (ie: interval-style) to change the way disabled days look. You can now change the disable date colors via css vars\n6. \'activeDate\' is now included in a lot of the scoped slots and events\n7. On interval-based calendars, when using the property "interval-minutes", those parts of the calendar are now called "interval sections" and can be changed via css vars. The default is to now have a "dashed" look, while at the main interval time, the lines are solid. Again, all changeable via css vars\n8. You no longer have to provide `.q-range-first`, `.q-range-last` and `.q-range` classes via `day-class` property for range selection. It\'s all built-in now.\n9. All deprecated slots and events were removed\n\nAlso, check out the new [Theme Builder](https://quasarframework.github.io/quasar-ui-qcalendar/theme-builder) in the docs.\n\nYou can find out more information [here](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-ui-qcalendar/releases/tag/v3.0.0).\n\n**v2.4.0**: New slots and events added. Current event system is deprecated, but still available until the next major version is released. To see the deprecated events in the **QCalendar API** (at bottom of the page), select the hamburger menu, then select **Show deprecated**. You can find out more information [here](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-ui-qcalendar/releases/tag/v2.4.0).\n\n\n**v2.2.0**: Please be aware of breaking changes in events and scoped slotted data. You can find out more information [here](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-ui-qcalendar/releases/tag/v2.2.0).\n\n---\n\n# Description\n\n**QCalendar** is a powerful calendar component that plugs right into your Quasar application. It allows for viewing of **day** (1-6 days), **week**, **monthly** (including **mini-mode**), **scheduler**, **resource** and **agenda** views. Painstaking care has been given to make almost every aspect of QCalendar configurable and/or modifiable in some way and control given to the developer.\n\nQCalendar is a less-opinionated calendar component, as it does not keep track of things like events and reminders. This is in the hands of the developer, but QCalendar makes it easy via accessible events, slots and methods (see examples how to accomplish these endeavors).\n\nThe guiding philosophy has been to empower the developer and allow them to do what needs to be done without being overly opinionated. In order to do this, the following items are followed:\n\n1. Separation of concerns\n2. Minimalization\n3. Closed to change, but open for extension\n\nThis is the true power of QCalendar.\n\n# Features\n- Show month, week, work-week, day, contiguous days (ex: 3 days at a time)\n- Scheduler view (optional hierarchical trees)\n- Resource view (optional hierarchical trees)\n- Agenda view (with optional Planner modes)\n- Month view mini-mode\n- Month view multi-day selection (toggle and range)\n- Month view multi-month/multi-day range selection when combining two or more calendars\n- Optional drag and drop support (including mobile)\n- Automatic localization / internationalization\n- Responsive flex grid layout\n- No external dependencies (momentjs, jQuery, etc), other than Quasar\n- User events support (date, day, interval, time, resource, etc)\n- Define any day as beginning of week\n- Show only certain days of the week (good for work week days)\n- Disable days or week days\n- Workweek number support\n- Day-of-the-year support\n- Easy to theme using CSS vars and [Theme Builder](https://quasarframework.github.io/quasar-ui-qcalendar/theme-builder)\n- Easy to customize with Vue slots\n- Support for Dark mode\n- Rich support of date functions that are also exported for use in your own apps\n\n## QCalendar is not...\n- An event management system. However, QCalendar supports everything you need to create an event/reminder management system using slots (check out the interactive demo).\n- An interactive navigation provider (next, previous, today). However, you can easily do this in devland with QCalendar\'s methods (see examples).\n- Only the Gregorian calendar is supported.\n\n::: warning\nQCalendar now uses css var since `v3.0.0`. IE11 does not use css vars, so essentially QCalendar no longer works with IE11. However, there is hope. If you are interested in IE11 support, you can read [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/edge-learnmore-neededge).\n:::\n\n# Installation Types\n\n## Quasar CLI\n\n**App Extension**\n\n:::\n#### Install\n\nTo add as an App Extension to your Quasar application, run the following (in your Quasar app folder):\n```\nquasar ext add @quasar/qcalendar\n```\n\n#### Uninstall\n\nTo remove as an App Extension from your Quasar application, run the following (in your Quasar app folder):\n```\nquasar ext remove @quasar/qcalendar\n```\n\n#### Describe\nWhen installed as an App Extension, you can use `quasar describe QCalendar`\n:::\n\n**OR**:\n\n:::\nCreate and register a boot file:\n\n```js\nimport Vue from \'vue\'\nimport Plugin from \'@quasar/quasar-ui-qcalendar\'\nimport \'@quasar/quasar-ui-qcalendar/dist/index.css\'\n\nVue.use(Plugin)\n```\n:::\n\n**OR**:\n\n:::\n```html\n<style src="@quasar/quasar-ui-qcalendar/dist/index.css"></style>\n\n<script>\nimport { QCalendar } from \'@quasar/quasar-ui-qcalendar\'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    QCalendar\n  }\n}\n<\/script>\n```\n:::\n\n## Vue CLI project\n\n:::\n```js\nimport Vue from \'vue\'\nimport Plugin from \'@quasar/quasar-ui-qcalendar\'\nimport \'@quasar/quasar-ui-qcalendar/dist/index.css\'\n\nVue.use(Plugin)\n```\n:::\n\n**OR**:\n\n:::\n```html\n<style src="@quasar/quasar-ui-qcalendar/dist/index.css"></style>\n\n<script>\nimport { QCalendar } from \'@quasar/quasar-ui-qcalendar\'\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    QCalendar\n  }\n}\n<\/script>\n```\n:::\n\n## UMD variant\n\nExports `window.QCalendar`.\n\nAdd the following tag(s) after the Quasar ones:\n\n:::\n```html\n<head>\n  \x3c!-- AFTER the Quasar stylesheet tags: --\x3e\n  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@quasar/quasar-ui-qcalendar/dist/index.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">\n</head>\n<body>\n  \x3c!-- at end of body, AFTER Quasar script(s): --\x3e\n  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@quasar/quasar-ui-qcalendar/dist/index.umd.min.js"><\/script>\n</body>\n```\nIf you need the RTL variant of the CSS, then go for the following (instead of the above stylesheet link):\n```html\n<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@quasar/quasar-ui-qcalendar/dist/index.rtl.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">\n```\n:::\n\n## Testing on Codepen\n[UMD Example on Codepen](https://codepen.io/Hawkeye64/pen/RwwwKQL)\n\n# Docs\nCan be found [here](https://quasarframework.github.io/quasar-ui-qcalendar).\n\n# Examples\nCan be found [here](https://quasarframework.github.io/quasar-ui-qcalendar/examples).\n\n# Interactive Demo\nCan be found [here](https://quasarframework.github.io/quasar-ui-qcalendar/demo).\n\n# Demo (source) Project\nCan be found [here](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-ui-qcalendar/tree/master/demo).\n\n---\n\n# Working with QCalendar\n\nIn order to get the best potential from QCalendar it is important to understand all aspects which will be described below.\n\nFirst and foremost, the date format used with the v-model, is `YYYY-MM-DD` (8601-1 format). This is to avoid confusion with positioning of the day and month in other date formats as well as date separator. All incoming and outgoing dates will use this format.\n\nThe default locale of QCalendar is **en-us**. This can easily be changed via the `locale` property. Any area of QCalendar that displays text and numbers is locale-aware via the browser\'s Internationalization (Intl) API.\n\nYou will see a number of images below which have the QCalendar component, but the navigation bar above all images is not part of QCalendar. Navigation is something a developer would provide in devland with QCalendar methods. This gives you total control over look-and-feel of your own navigation bar.\n\n![WeekView](qcalendar-toolbar.png "Week View" =800x800)\n\nYou would need to build out your own way of allowing the User to interact with QCalendar (if that is what you wish). Or, keep a fixed calendar.\n\n# QCalendar views\n\nQCalendar is made from five distict components: **day**, **month**, **scheduler**, **resource** and **agenda** views. All other views derive from these views. For instance, the **week** view is really a 7-**day** view with contraints.\n\nNot only all these, but the **month** view has a **mini-mode** behavior.\n\n## Day view\n\n![DayView](qcalendar-day-view.png "Day View" =800x800)\n\nThe `day` view is for displaying time intervals on the left side and 1 or more days in a contiguous fashion on the right side.\n\n![DayView](qcalendar-day-view--intervals.png "Day View" =800x800)\n\nYou have full control over the granularity of the interval section.\n\n## Week view\n\nWhen more than one day is displayed:\n\n![WeekView](qcalendar-week-view.png "Week View" =800x800)\n\n## Custom Interval view\n\nThe `custom-interval` view allows you to display as many days as specified by the property `max-days`. This can get a bit busy if a large number of days are displayed and is only recommended for wide screens. The image below has `max-days` set to 14.\n\n![CustomInterval](qcalendar-custom-interval-view.png "Custom Interval" =800x800)\n\n## Month Interval view\n\nThe `month-interval` view allows you to display all days in a month while in the interval mode. This can get a bit busy and is only recommended for wide screens. The difference between the `month-interval` view and the `custom-interval` view is that the `month-interval` view has special handling for month length and will only go as many days as there are in the displayed month.\n\n![MonthInterval](qcalendar-month-interval-view.png "Month Interval" =800x800)\n\n## Month view\n\n![MonthView](qcalendar-month-view.png "Month View" =800x800)\n\nThe `month` view is for displaying a finite number of weeks according to the calendar time which is the currently displayed month.\n\n> For time periods which fall outside of the current month, yet are still displayed (beginning and ending days of the month view), these are known as the `outside` days. The current date is known as the `current` day (obviously). Days leading up to the current date are known as `past` days and days that come after the current date are known as `future` days.\n\nThe image above also highlights the use of the day slot for events. The next image is highlighting the week slot for better multi-day events.\n\n![MonthViewWeekSlot](qcalendar-month-view--week-slot.png "Month View week slot" =800x800)\n\n### Mini-Mode\n\n![MonthViewMiniModeSelection](q-calendar-month-view-mini-mode-with-selection.png "Month View Mini-Mode with Multi-Day Selection" =300x300)\n\nThe `month` view also has a `mini-mode` property with additional (if needed) `breakpoint` behavior.\n\nAnd, when combined with two or mode calendars allows you to have multi-month range selection.\n\n![MonthViewMiniModeMultiMonthSelection](qcalendar-month-view-mini-mode-multi-month-selection.png "Month View Mini-Mode with Multi-Month Selection" =400x400)\n\n## Scheduler view\n\n![SchedulerView](qcalendar-scheduler-view.png "Scheduler View" =800x800)\n\nThe `scheduler` view is for displaying days with resources on the left side. This allows you to present data for each resource. Where a resource could be a person, room, etc.\n\nTo use the scheduler, you need to use the `resources` property, which is an array of objects, containing a key as defined by the `resource-key` (default `label`). To change the number of days displayed, use the `max-days` property. To change the distance between each resource, use the `resource-height` property.\n\n![SchedulerViewHierarchial](qcalendar-scheduler-view--hierarchial.png  "Scheduler View with Children" =800x800)\n\nThe **Scheduler View** can also show hierarchical trees. Using the `resources` object, you can add `expanded` (boolean) and `children` (array) keys. Set the `expanded` key to `true` if you wish the tree to be expanded on first draw.\n\n```js\nresources: [\n  { label: \'John\' },\n  {\n    label: \'Board Room\',\n    expanded: false,\n    children: [\n      { label: \'Room-1\' },\n      {\n        label: \'Room-2\',\n        expanded: false,\n        children: [\n          { label: \'Partition-A\' },\n          { label: \'Partition-B\' },\n          { label: \'Partition-C\' }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  { label: \'Mary\' },\n  { label: \'Susan\' },\n  { label: \'Olivia\' }\n]\n```\n\n## Resource view\n\n![ResourceView](qcalendar-resource-view.png "Resource View" =800x800)\n\nThe `resource` view is for displaying resources (people, rooms, etc) down the side and with time intervals on top. The time intervals and resource sections can be made `sticky` with a property of the same name.\n\nTo use the resource view, you need to use the `resources` property, which is an array of objects, containing a key as defined by the `resource-key` (default `label`).\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\n:resources="resources"\nresource-key="label"\n```\n\nwhere:\n\n```js\nresources: [\n  { lable: \'John\',\n    events: [\n      { date: \'2002-05-30\', time: \'10:00\', duration: 60, title: \'meeting\' },\n      ...\n    ]}\n]\n```\n\nYour resources can contain whatever data you want and will be accessible via slots where the resouce is passed.\n\nIf you wanted to hold event information as the above example, and wanted to make it more dynamic, listen for the `change` event, which gives you start and end timestamps, collect the data from the server, then dynamically set it on your resource. Remember, don\'t assign the data directly, or you will loose Vue reactivity, instead use the `splice` command.\n\n![ResourceViewHierarchial](qcalendar-resource-view--hierarchial.png "Resource View Children" =800x800)\n\nThe **Resource View** can also show hierarchical trees. Using the `resources` object, you can add `expanded` (boolean) and `children` (array) keys. Set the `expanded` key to `true` if you wish the tree to be expanded on first draw.\n\n```js\nresources: [\n  { label: \'John\' },\n  {\n    label: \'Board Room\',\n    expanded: false,\n    children: [\n      { label: \'Room-1\' },\n      {\n        label: \'Room-2\',\n        expanded: false,\n        children: [\n          { label: \'Partition-A\' },\n          { label: \'Partition-B\' },\n          { label: \'Partition-C\' }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  { label: \'Mary\' },\n  { label: \'Susan\' },\n  { label: \'Olivia\' }\n]\n```\n\n## Agenda view\n\n::: info\nIn **Agenda** view mode, the developer is free to add whatever content they want. The example below just shows one of many ways it could be done.\n:::\n\nThe `agenda` view is basically a `day` view without the intervals. It is up to the developer to provide the content via the `day-body` slot. But, knowing this, all the interval properties can be applied and your slotted content could adhere to proper positioning based on the time.\n\n\n## Agenda view (Planner)\n\n![AgendaViewColumnOptions](qcalendar-agenda-view--column-options.png "Agenda View column options" =800x800)\n\nWhile in **Agenda** view, you can define extra columns on the left-side or right-side of the calendar. This is perfect for creating Planners.\n\n![PlannerExample](qcalendar-agenda-view--planner.png "Planner Example" =800x800)\n\nIf this interests you, check out the [Planner Example](/demos/planner).\n\n## View types\n\nQCalendar has many `view` types available. They are:\n1. `day`\n2. `2day`\n3. `3day`\n4. `4day`\n5. `5day`\n6. `6day`\n7. `week`\n8. `month`\n9. `scheduler`\n10. `day-scheduler`\n11. `2day-scheduler`\n12. `3day-scheduler`\n13. `4day-scheduler`\n14. `5day-scheduler`\n15. `6day-scheduler`\n16. `week-scheduler`\n17. `month-scheduler`\n18. `custom-scheduler`\n19. `resource`\n20. `day-resource`\n21. `day-agenda`\n22. `2day-agenda`\n23. `3day-agenda`\n24. `4day-agenda`\n25. `5day-agenda`\n26. `6day-agenda`\n27. `month-agenda`\n28. `week-agenda`\n29. `custom-agenda`\n30. `month-interval`\n31. `custom-interval`\n\nIt\'s important to know that all `view` types are linear in nature. For instance, `3day` will show three days and the `next()` method will show the next 3 days. A good idea could be to switch to a `view` type on a mobile based on the current width of the screen. For portrait mode, you could change the `view` type to `2day` and for landscape mode `4day`. When `next()` or `prev()` methods are called the next (or previous) 2 days (for protrait) or 4 days (for landscape) would be displayed. Also, it is important to understand, if using a 5-day work week, then use the `week` view for a nice consistent linear calendar. If you use a `5day` view with a 5-day workweek (`[1,2,3,4,5]`), then you can\'t expect the monday to be on the first day of the week.\n\nWeek and Month views are also linear, but respect the number of days displayed within the week or month respectfully.\n\nAll views respect the number of weekdays to be displayed as per the `weekdays` filter property.\n\n## Weekday filtering\n\nQCalendar supports weekday filtering using the `weekdays` property. This is an array of numbers representing the days of the week, where `0` is Sunday and `6` is Saturday. The default looks like this: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.\n\nIf the desire was to display only the work week (meaning Monday to Friday), the `weekdays` property would be set like this: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n\n![Week5day](qcalendar-week-view-5day.png "Week 5 day" =800x800)\n\n![Month5day](qcalendar-month-view-5day.png "Month 5 day" =800x800)\n\nAs well, if the goal was to display Monday as the first day of the week (as does the German, and other, calendars), the `weekdays` property would be set like this: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0]`.\n\n![WeekMondayFirstDay](qcalendar-week-view-monday-first-day.png "Week - Monday First Day" =800x800)\n\n![MonthMondayFirstDay](qcalendar-month-view-monday-first-day.png "Month - Monday First Day" =800x800)\n\n**Expected Results**\nIf you are trying to do a 5-day week always use the `week`, `month`, `month-interval`, `week-scheduler`, `month-scheduler` or `week-agenda` views to do the filtering (basically views that respect the length of a week or month). The `2day` to `6day` views as well as `custom-interval` and `scheduler` views are linear and won\'t give you the expected results.\n\nThis image has set up a 5-day work week (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`) **incorrectly** using a `5day` filter.\n\n![Incorrect5Day](qcalendar-5day-done-incorrectly.png "5 Day - Set up incorrectly" =800x800)\n\n## Workweek numbers\nQCalendar supports workweek numbers (also known as [ISO week date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date)). That is, the numbered week from the start of the year. This is only available in `month` view by setting the `workweek` property to true.\n\n![WorkWeek](qcalendar-workweeks.png "Workweek or ISO Week Date" =800x800)\n\n# Navigation\n\nNavigating QCalendar can be done in several ways:\n\n1. Setting the `value` (v-model) property\n2. Calling `next()` and `prev()` functions\n3. Calling the `move()` function\n4. Calling the `updateCurrent()` function\n\nOut of this, the most common would be to use the `value` (v-model) property and the `prev()` and `next()` functions.\n\n```html\n<q-calendar ref="calendar" ...\n```\n\nand then in JavaScript:\n\n```js\n  methods: {\n    calendarNext () {\n      this.$refs.calendar.next()\n    },\n    calendarPrev () {\n      this.$refs.calendar.prev()\n    },\n```\n\n## Swipe navigation\n\nQCalendar does not provide swipe navigation out-of-the-box. The philosophy is to allow the developer to make navigation choices and availability. However, with **Quasar** it is quite easy to add swipe navigation to your calendar.\n\nFirst, in your `quasar.conf.js` make sure to add `TouchSwipe` to your directives.\n\n```js\ndirectives: [\n  \'Ripple\',\n  \'ClosePopup\',\n  \'TouchSwipe\'\n],\n```\n\nThen on your `q-calendar` tag, add the following:\n\n```html\n<q-calendar\n  ref="calendar"\n  v-touch-swipe.mouse.left.right="handleSwipe"\n  ...\n```\n\nAnd, finally, in your JavaScript, handle the `handleSwipe` function:\n\n```js\nhandleSwipe ({ evt, ...info }) {\n  if (info.duration >= 30) {\n    if (info.direction === \'right\') {\n      this.calendarPrev()\n    } else if (info.direction === \'left\') {\n      this.calendarNext()\n    }\n  }\n  evt.cancelable !== false && evt.preventDefault()\n  evt.stopPropagation()\n}\n```\nSee the Demo code for more information (link at top of page).\n\n# Locale\n\nQCalendar supports locales as defined within the browser and can be changed by setting the `locale` property. If an invalid locale is used, the fallback locale of **en-us** will be used.\n\nIf you are handling a toolbar with previous, next, today options and would also like to format the current month, you can do something like this to get the browser to do the translation for you.\n\n```js\n  beforeMount () {\n    this.locale = this.$q.lang.getLocale() || \'en-us\'\n    this.updateFormatter()\n  },\n```\n```js\n  watch: {\n    locale () {\n      if (this.locale.length > 2) {\n        this.updateFormatter()\n      }\n    },\n    shortMonthLabel () {\n      this.updateFormatter()\n    }\n  },\n```\nThen in `methods`:\n```js\n    updateFormatter () {\n      try {\n        this.titleFormatter = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(this.locale || undefined, {\n          month: this.shortMonthLabel ? \'short\' : \'long\',\n          year: \'numeric\',\n          timeZone: \'UTC\'\n        })\n      } catch (e) {\n        // console.error(\'Intl.DateTimeFormat not supported\')\n        this.titleFormatter = undefined\n      }\n    },\n```\nand then in `computed`:\n```js\n    title () {\n      if (this.titleFormatter && this.locale && this.selectedDate) {\n        const date = new Date(this.selectedDate)\n        return this.titleFormatter.format(date)\n      }\n      return \'\'\n    },\n```\nNow, you can use the computed variable `this.title`.\n\n![Arabic](qcalendar-locale-arabic.png "Locale - Arabic" =800x800)\n![Chinese](qcalendar-locale-chinese.png "Locale - Chinese" =800x800)\n![French](qcalendar-locale-french.png "Locale - French" =800x800)\n![German](qcalendar-locale-german.png "Locale - German" =800x800)\n![Romanian](qcalendar-locale-romanian.png "Locale - Romanian" =800x800)\n\n# Themes\n\nQCalendar has the ability to change colors via css vars with support for browser dark mode.\n\n![ThemeDark](qcalendar-theme-dark.png "Theme - Dark" =800x800)\n![ThemeTeal](qcalendar-theme-teal.png "Theme - Teal" =800x800)\n![ThemeBrown](qcalendar-theme-brown.png "Theme - Brown" =800x800)\n![ThemeDeepPurple](qcalendar-theme-deep-purple.png "Theme - Deep Purple" =800x800)\n![ThemeIndigo](qcalendar-theme-indigo.png "Theme - Indigo" =800x800)\n![ThemeBlue](qcalendar-theme-blue.png "Theme - Blue" =800x800)\n\nAll of these themes are used in the examples. You don\'t have to use them. You can build out your own color themes with the [Theme Builder](https://quasarframework.github.io/quasar-ui-qcalendar/theme-builder).\n\n# Animating\n\nAnimation is when QCalendar does a `prev` or `next` action. Setting the property `:animated="true"` turns on the animation. Two other properties, `transition-prev` and `transition-next` allows you to set the type of transition to use. The default is to use `transition-prev="slide-right"` and `transition-next="slide-left"`, but you can use any of the [Quasar transitions](https://quasar.dev/options/transitions), or build your own (see [Vue transitions](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html) for detailed information).\n\n# Drag and Drop support\nQCalendar supports HTML5 **drag and drop**. If you have components that need drag and drop support you can add the following (this example is using QBadge):\n\n```html\n  <q-calendar\n    :drag-over-func="onDragOver"\n    :drop-func="onDrop"\n  >\n```\nThe above is need to set the calendar as a drop point.\n\n```html\n<template #day="{ date }">\n  <template v-for="(event, index) in getEvents(date)">\n    <q-badge\n      :key="index"\n      style="width: 100%; cursor: pointer;"\n      :class="badgeClasses(event, \'day\')"\n      :style="badgeStyles(event, \'day\')"\n      @click.stop.prevent="showEvent(event)"\n      :draggable="true"\n      @dragstart="(e) => onDragStart(e, event)"\n      @dragend="(e) => onDragEnd(e, event)"\n      @dragenter="(e) => onDragEnter(e, event)"\n      @touchmove="(e) => {}"\n    >\n      <q-icon v-if="event.icon" :name="event.icon" class="q-mr-xs" /><span class="ellipsis">{{ event.title }}</span>\n    </q-badge>\n  </template>\n</template>\n```\nRemember, to kick off a drag and drop, you must `preventDefault` during the `dragenter` event:\n\n```js\nonDragEnter (ev, event) {\n  ev.preventDefault()\n},\nonDragStart (ev, event) {\n  this.dragging = true\n  this.draggedEvent = event\n  ev.stopPropagation()\n},\nonDragEnd (ev, event) {\n  ev.preventDefault()\n  ev.stopPropagation()\n  this.resetDrag()\n},\nonDragOver (ev, day, type) {\n  if (type === \'day\') {\n    ev.preventDefault()\n    ev.stopPropagation()\n    return this.draggedEvent.date !== day.date\n  } else if (type === \'interval\') {\n    ev.preventDefault()\n    ev.stopPropagation()\n    return this.draggedEvent.date !== day.date && this.draggedEvent.time !== day.time\n  }\n},\nonDrop (ev, day, type) {\n  ev.preventDefault()\n  ev.stopPropagation()\n  if (type === \'day\') {\n    this.draggedEvent.date = day.date\n    this.draggedEvent.side = undefined\n  } else if (type === \'interval\') {\n    this.draggedEvent.date = day.date\n    this.draggedEvent.time = day.time\n    this.draggedEvent.side = undefined\n  }\n},\nresetDrag () {\n  this.draggedEvent = undefined\n  this.dragging = false\n  if (Platform.is.desktop) {\n    this.ignoreNextSwipe = true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Mobile support\nDrag and drop is typically not directly supported on mobile browsers. If you want support, add the package `drag-drop-touch` to your `package.json`. And then, just `import \'drag-drop-touch\'` to get it to shim into your code. When using this shim, you need the `@touchmove.native="(e) => {}"` as noted above to prevent issues with iOS.\n\n# Working with Slots\nThere is a lot of Scoped Slots support in QCalendar. Scoped Slots allows you to change the look of your calendar to suit your requirements. Almost all of the scoped slots work with the QCalendar `timestamp` (also known as `day`) object.\n\nThe `timestamp` object looks like this:\n```js\n{\n  date: \'\',       // YYYY-MM-DD\n  time: \'\',       // HH:MM (optional)\n  year: 0,        // YYYY\n  month: 0,       // MM (Jan = 1, etc)\n  day: 0,         // day of the month\n  weekday: 0,     // week day\n  hour: 0,        // 24-hr\n  minute: 0,      // mm\n  doy: 0,         // day of year\n  workweek: 0,    // workweek number\n  hasDay: false,  // if this timestamp is supposed to have a date\n  hasTime: false, // if this timestamp is supposed to have a time\n  past: false,    // if timestamp is in the past (based on `now` property)\n  current: false, // if timestamp is current date (based on `now` property)\n  future: false,  // if timestamp is in the future (based on `now` property)\n  disabled: false // if timestamp is disabled\n}\n```\n\n# Working with Events\n\nQCalendar has a lot of events. The normal events are:\n\n`@input => function(value)`: This is the value used by `v-model` and in the form `YYYY-MM-DD`\n\n`@change => function(start, end)`: Emitted when the calendar dates change. For instance, if in month view, the `start` contains the timestamp object for the 1st of the month, and `end` contains the timestamp object for the last day of the month. For `week` view it’s the first day of the displayed week and last day of the displayed week\n\n`@moved => function (timestamp)`: The same as `input` above, except the passed argument is a `timestamp` object.\n\nAll other events are mouse/touch based. The base events are:\n1. `click`\n2. `contextmenu`\n3. `mousedown`\n4. `mousemove`\n5. `mouseup`\n6. `mouseenter`\n7. `mouseleave`\n8. `touchstart`\n9. `touchmove`\n10. `touchend`\n\nThese are appended with the type of event:\n1. `:time2`\n2. `:day2`\n3. `:day:header2`\n4. `:workweek2`\n5. `:interval2`\n6. `:interval:header2`\n7. `:resource2`\n8. `:resource:day2`\n9. `:column2`\n10. `:column:header2`\n11. `:workweek2`\n12. `:workweek:header2`\n\nAll mouse/touch events support the Vue [Event & Key Modifiers](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/render-function.html#Event-amp-Key-Modifiers).\n\nAll the examples for the various views have an Event example. Be sure to check it out for the view you are working with.\n\n# Providing Mouse Hover\n\nThe Interactive Demo has mouse hover coloring. It\'s been asked many times how this is done. The calendar is wrapped with a class `.calendar-container`. Here is the sass that provides the hover effects:\n\n```css\n<style lang="sass">\n.calendar-container\n  position: relative\n\n  .q-calendar-daily__day-interval:hover\n    background: rgba(0,0,255,.1)\n\n  .q-calendar-weekly__workweek:hover\n    background: rgba(0,0,255,.1)\n\n  .q-calendar-weekly__day:hover\n    background: rgba(0,0,255,.1)\n\n  .q-calendar-weekly__head-weekday:hover\n    background: rgba(0,0,255,.1)\n\n  .q-calendar-scheduler__day:hover\n    background: rgba(0,0,255,.1)\n\n  .q-calendar-resource__resource-interval:hover\n    background: rgba(0,0,255,.1)\n\n  .q-calendar-daily__day:hover\n    background: rgba(0,0,255,.1)\n</style>\n```\n\n~~~\n',d=a("7975"),r=a("04c3"),i={name:"PageIndex",components:{Hero:o["a"]},data:function(){return{markdown:c,json:d,json2:r}},computed:{toc:{get:function(){return this.$store.state.common.toc},set:function(e){this.$store.commit("common/toc",e)}}},methods:{onToc:function(e){e.push({id:"QCalendar-API",label:"QCalendar API",level:1,children:Array(0)}),e.push({id:"QCalendar-Exports",label:"QCalendar Exports",level:1,children:Array(0)}),e.push({id:"Donate",label:"Donate",level:1,children:Array(0)}),this.toc=e}}},p=i,m=a("2877"),l=a("5096"),u=a("9c40"),h=a("eebe"),y=a.n(h),b=Object(m["a"])(p,s,n,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=b.exports;y()(b,"components",{QPageScroller:l["a"],QBtn:u["a"]})}}]);
