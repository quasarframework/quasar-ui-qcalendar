## Design

You do not have to be a developer to contribute to a new QCalendar component. You can also design one and either core developers will work on it or the community will get involved.
## Parts of a component contribution

Component contributions ideally include all of the following parts.

1. **A rationale**
Explain how your component will add value to the system. QCalendar serves the widest possible range of calendar products, and contributions that increase the scope of the system are more likely to be accepted. Be sure to include any user experience and interaction descriptions.

2. **A design spec**
Create sizing and styling annotations for all aspects of the component. This spec should provide a developer with everything they need to create the design in code.

3. **Code documentation**
We recommend reading through existing code documentation on this site for inspiration.

## First steps to contributing

To contribute a component to QCalendar, start by opening a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-ui-qcalendar/issues). Include a detailed description in which you:

- Explain the rationale
- Detail the intended behavior
- Clarify whether it’s a variation of an existing component, or a new asset
- Include mockups of any fidelity (optional)
- Include any inspirations from other products (optional)

This issue will be the staging ground for the contribution and an opportunity for the community to weigh in with any suggestions. We encourage you to surface work in progress. Someone in the community may be working on the same component and interested in collaborating with you.
