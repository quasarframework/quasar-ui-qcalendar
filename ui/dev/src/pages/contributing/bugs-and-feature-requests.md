## Checking for known issues

### Github

We use Github to track our bugs. If you have a bug to report or wish to request a new feature, please check the [existing issues](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-ui-qcalendar/issues) before opening a new one. There may already be something similar in the works.

### QCalendar website

Please take some time to explore the content on this website before opening an issue. The site is comprehensive and most guidelines and components are well documented.

## Creating an issue

Report bugs, request features, and leave feedback with a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-ui-qcalendar/issues).

## GitHub pull requests

If you have a specific fix or contribution, start by generating a pull request in the appropriate [QCalendar repo](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-ui-qcalendar/pulls).

## Requests for comment

For changes that are larger in scale, an RFC (request for comment) may be appropriate. You can do that in the [QCalendar discussions](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-ui-qcalendar/discussions).

## Need more help?

If you have more questions about issues or requesting features, there are multiple ways to reach us at [Contact us](/help/contact-us).
