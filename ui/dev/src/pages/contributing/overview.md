Interested in contributing to QCalendar? Here's how you can contribute:

## Introduction

QCalendar is free to use (MIT License) for anybody building a web-based product or website. The QCalendar community is always working to make it better. Contributors like you help make QCalendar great! We are verry happy to see you here.

Contributions are not limited to code. We also encourage feedback, documentation, new design and tools. And, we also encourage [sponsorship](/contributing/sponsor), especially if you are using QCalendar in a business endeavor. 

All you need is a [Github account](https://github.com/join) to get started.

## Working in the open

QCalendar lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-ui-qcalendar). All work, discussion, issues, bugs, features, improvements, and comments happen right out in the open where everyone can see.

If you’re looking for something that we don’t have, or you notice something could be improved, you have two options:

1. Open an issue for the request. We’ll review the issue and get back to you with next steps. If we decide the request should be part of our pipeline, we’ll add it to our roadmap. There are never timeline guarantees for requests, but we’ll do our best to give you an estimate.

2. Begin the work yourself and contribute it back to QCalendar. We appreciate complete contributions but also works in progress. You’re welcome to open an issue to surface your work and we’ll weigh in and help where we can.

Regardless of how you choose to contribute, we encourage you to open an issue as early as possible in the process.
